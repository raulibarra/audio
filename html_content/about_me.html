            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I’m Raúl Ibarra Aranda, a passionate <strong>technical music composer, sound designer, and game developer</strong>
                with over 9 years of experience in the gaming industry. I specialize in creating immersive and dynamic audio
                experiences that elevate storytelling and enhance gameplay. From crafting original scores to designing intricate
                soundscapes and implementing cutting-edge audio technologies, I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical
                expertise to every project.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate with world-class game studios like <strong>Somatone Interactive</strong>, 
                <strong>Redemption Games Inc.</strong>, <strong>Globant and Giant Monkey Robot</strong>, contributing to high-profile projects such as 
                <strong>Power Rangers™ Morphin Legends</strong>, <strong>Marvel World of Heroes</strong>, and <strong>Dolby Atmos Sample Game</strong>. 
                My work is driven by a deep love for music and sound, as well as a desire to push the boundaries of what game audio can achieve.
            </p>
            <p>With a strong foundation in <strong>music theory, sound design principles</strong>, and expertise in tools like
                <strong>FMOD, Wwise, Pro Tools, and Ableton Live</strong>, I ensure that every audio element I create is both
                technically sound and artistically engaging. Whether I’m composing adaptive music scores or designing spatial audio
                systems, my goal is always to deliver an unforgettable sonic experience that resonates with players.
            </p>
            <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a <strong>Master’s Degree in Music Composition for Video Games</strong>, which further
                deepens my understanding of interactive music and sound design. I’m always looking for exciting new challenges and
                collaborations where I can apply my skills to create memorable game experiences.</p>
