            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>I'm Raúl Ibarra Aranda, a technical music composer, sound designer, and game developer with over 9 years of
                experience in the gaming industry. I specialize in creating immersive audio that enhances storytelling and
                gameplay. Whether composing original scores, designing soundscapes, or working with the latest audio tech, I
                combine creativity with technical know-how.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked with top game studios like Somatone Interactive, Redemption Games, and Globant, on projects such as
                <em>Power Rangers™ Morphin Legends</em> and <em>Marvel World of Heroes</em>. I'm also skilled in FMOD, Wwise,
                Pro Tools, Cubase, and Reaper, with a strong background in music theory and sound design.</p>
            <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Music Composition for Video Games, and I’m always open to new challenges
                that push the limits of game audio.</p>
