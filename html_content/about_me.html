            <h3>About me:</h3>
            <p>Welcome! I’m Raúl Ibarra Aranda, an accomplished audio programmer and game developer dedicated to crafting immersive audio experiences. 
                With a deep expertise in sound design and music composition, I strive to enhance storytelling and user engagement in every project I undertake.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked with top companies like Somatone Interactive, Redemption Games, and Globant, on projects such as
                <em>Power Rangers™ Morphin Legends</em> and <em>Marvel World of Heroes</em>. I'm also skilled in FMOD, Wwise,
                Pro Tools, Cubase, and Reaper, with a strong background in music theory and sound design.</p>
            <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s in Music Composition for Video Games, and I’m always open to new challenges
                that push the limits of game audio.</p>
